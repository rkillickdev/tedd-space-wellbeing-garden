# **Tedd-Space Wellbeing Garden Website**
The Tedd-Space website has been designed to provide visitors with the opportunity to gather information about a fictional community wellbeing garden based in Teddington, TW11.  The goal of the site owner is to create an online presence to give greater exposure to the garden and increase the user base within the TW11 community. There is a particular emphasis on the positive impact of horticulture and nature on our wellbeing and mental health.

Site users can learn about the ethos and vision of the garden, gain better understanding of the links between nature and wellbeing, gather information about how the garden engages the local community, and easily find the details they need to visit.   They can also learn about volunteering opportunities and register their interest in getting involved.

## **STRATEGY**
___

### **Why build this site?**
<br>
The wellbeing garden was completed in April 2022. Market research carried out by Richmond Council within the local community has highlighted that many residents of TW11 do not know about the garden. So a core goal of the website will be to increase exposure in the hope of attracting a new diverse user base.

<br>

Research has highlighted the toll that the pandemic had on wellbeing and mental health.  So another core goal of the website will be to emphasise how the benefits of the garden can be two fold. Time spent outside engaging with nature along with the opportunity to reduce isolation by connecting with the community.

<br>

### **What is needed?**

<br>

The website will be an online resource where users will go to understand more about the garden, how they can visit and how it could improve their lives.

## **STRUCTURE**

___

<br>

The header will display the site name and logo to the left and a responsive navigation bar will be positioned to the right.  This header will remain fixed as you scroll down the page, always allowing the user to easily jump to the section they are interested in.  Clicking on the site name will take you back to the top of the page.  Clicking on the navigation links will jump you to the relevant section. Following the principles of information architecture,  as these links are all closely tied to the core user needs and owner objectives they are positioned at the highest level of the site.

While navigating the site, content hinting will lead users from one section to the next, encouraging them to scroll.  There will be progressive disclosure with content revealed gradually.  A first time user will start by learning about the goals and ethos of the garden, then the benefits associated with a well being garden, then the additional opportunities to engage with the community through classes and activities.  Finally with all of this information presented to the user, they will hopefully want to visit and seek out the address/ opening hours.

Clicking on the volunteer link will jump users to a new page with identical header and footer sections for consistency of user experience.  Here they will be presented some information about the volunteering opportunities.  The user will also have the opportunity to interact with a form by submitting their name, email address, using checkboxes to provide useful information and a text box for any further details.  A send button will allow users to submit this information.  

The footer will also remain fixed at the bottom of the page, displaying social media icons so the user can intuitively link to the garden’s facebook, twitter and instagram pages.

To ensure consistency of scenario, make navigation intuitive and align with user expectation, all links will have an effect applied on hovering so the user knows these are clickable. Colour palettes, spacing and typography will remain consistent throughout to give the user a sense of familiarity wherever they navigate to on the site.  Icons will be used alongside informational headings to hint at content.

Links to any external sites will open in a new tab.
