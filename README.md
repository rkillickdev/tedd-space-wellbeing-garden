# **Tedd-Space Wellbeing Garden Website**

## **Site Goals**

<br>

The Tedd-Space website has been designed to provide visitors with the opportunity to gather information about a fictional community wellbeing garden based in Teddington, TW11.  The goal of the site owner is to create an online presence to give greater exposure to the garden and increase the user base within the TW11 community. There is a particular emphasis on the positive impact of horticulture and nature on our wellbeing and mental health.

Site users can learn about the ethos and vision of the garden, gain better understanding of the links between nature and wellbeing, gather information about how the garden engages the local community, and easily find the details they need to visit.   They can also learn about volunteering opportunities and register their interest in getting involved.

# **User Experience (UX)**

## **STRATEGY**
___

### **Why build this site?**
<br>
The wellbeing garden was completed in April 2022. Market research carried out by Richmond Council within the local community has highlighted that many residents of TW11 do not know about the garden. So a core goal of the website will be to increase exposure in the hope of attracting a new diverse user base.

<br>

Research has highlighted the toll that the pandemic had on wellbeing and mental health.  So another core goal of the website will be to emphasise how the benefits of the garden can be two fold. Time spent outside engaging with nature along with the opportunity to reduce isolation by connecting with the community.

<br>

### **What is needed?**

<br>

The website will be an online resource where users will go to understand more about the garden, how they can visit and how it could improve their lives.

<br>

<br>



### **Features To Be Included:**

<br>

* An About section that makes the user aware of what the garden is and its primary goals and objectives.

* A Wellbeing section that explains some of the design features used in the garden to promote positive mental health.

* A Community section where the user can learn ways in which the garden can be used to stay active, interact with others and educate future generations.

* A Visit section where users can obtain the information they need to visit the garden - address details, opening hours.

* A Volunteer section where users can find out more about the volunteers that help run the garden.  If interested there is an opportunity for the user to make contact via a form.

<br>

### **Future Implementations:**

<br>

* Addition of a news, updates and upcoming events section.  For now this information can be accessed externally by clicking social media links, but it would nice to eventually integrate a live feed into the site.

* Addition of a blog page with varied topics covered.  This would give the user the chance to find out more detailed information about the core goals of the site owner, for example in depth features and articles about how gardens and horticulture can improve our physical and mental wellbeing.  This would be a neater solution than simply adding links for articles on external sites.

<br>

## **STRUCTURE**

___

<br>

### **Common Features**

<br>

* A favicon is displayed in each browser tab.  The image is a squared off version of the logo used in the header. It is a 16px X 16px ico file generated on the [Favicon.ico & App Icon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) 

![Tedd-Space Favicon in browser tab](docs/snapshots/tedd-space-favicon-snapshot.png)

* The header will feature at the top of each page with the site name and logo to the left and a responsive navigation bar will be positioned to the right.  This header will remain fixed as you scroll down the page, always allowing the user to easily jump to the section they are interested in.  Clicking on the Tedd-Space name and logo wil always take the user back to the about page.  Clicking on the navigation links will jump the user to the relevant section. Following the principles of information architecture,  as these links are all closely tied to the core user needs and owner objectives they are positioned at the highest level of the site.  Hovering over any of the navigation menu links transforms the font size to 120% and the cursor changes to a hand pointer, indicating that clicking will take the user to a new page, therefore making the experience intuitive.  The current page link in the menu shows as bold to always inform the user where they are within the site.   

![Tedd-Space nav menu above 950px](docs/snapshots/tedd-space-nav-menu-above-950px.png)

* To ensure a good user experience in all situations, a media query is used to prevent the naviagtion bar looking squashed and cluttered on mobile devices with smaller screen sizes.  The navigation bar is replaced with a burger menu toggler at 950px and under.  For screens at 450px and under, a further media query is used to reduce the overall size of these header items to give everything space.  When the burger icon is selected, the header expands vertically with the navigation menu displayed. I have chosen this method of using the burger icon as it follows convention and is immediately recognisable.  It therefore aligns with user expectation, providing them with an intuitive experience as they navigate the sight.  A recognisable cross icon is used to indicate to the user that clicking will close the menu.

![Tedd-Space nav menu below 950px](docs/snapshots/tedd-space-nav-menu-below-950px.png)

![Tedd-Space mobile nav menu expanded](docs/snapshots/mobile-nav-expanded.png)

* The footer will feature at the bottom of each page, with social media links to the Tedd-Space Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages opening in new browser tabs when clicked.  Font awesome icons are used as they are universally recognisable for the user without the need for text.  A hover effect which transforms the icon size to 110% and changes the colour to a lighter green indicates to the user that these links are clickable.  A secondary navigation menu is positioned in the centre of the footer, incase the user is ever at the bottom of the page and wants to naviage to a new location.  A hover effect increasing the font size to 120% indicates that these links are clickable. To ensure that the Tedd-Space brand is visible throughout, the name appears on the left of the footer and clicking on this will always direct the user back to the home page.

![Tedd-Space Footer represented on different devices](docs/snapshots/tedd-space-footer-am-i-responsive.png)

<br>

### **About Page**

<br>

* The aim of the owner is that the purpose of the site should be immediately evident to the user when they land on the home page.  This is achieved by using a hero image of a close up leaf that instantly indicates to the user that the site relates to nature and the dark green colour aims to achieve an emotional response of calmness.  The user is then provided with two core pieces of information as the hero text fades in, to make clear that Tedd-Space is a wellbeing garden and it is located in the TW11 postcode.

![Tedd-Space hero image represented on different devices](docs/snapshots/tedd-space-index-am-i-responsive.png)

* The user is then provided with a concise welcome section where they can understand exactly what Tedd-Space is and what it aims to achieve. This is accompanied by an image which hopes to envoke a positive emotional response ( "this is somewhere I would like to spend time" ) and draws them to learning more about the wellbeing garden.

* The core goals of Tedd-Space are laid out next, to demonstrate to the user 3 different ways the garden could benefit them.  Icons are used above each goal as hints, so the user understands the core aims of Tedd-Space before they have even read the etxt.  Under each goal, an explore button makes it intuitive for the user to learn more about each topic without even having to use the top navigation menu.  This is an example of using progressive disclosure, to engage the user and gradually present them with more content as they navigate the website.  For consistency of user experience, the explore buttons feature the same transform effect on hovering as experienced in the header and footer.

<br>

![Tedd-Space About Page represented on different devices](docs/snapshots/tedd-space-about-am-i-responsive.png)

### **Wellbeing Page**

<br>

* This page provides the user with further information about how the Tedd-Space garden can improve wellbeing.  To ensure consitency of user experience, the page layout is similar in format to the about page. There is a concise intro, a calm image to convey the theme of wellbeing and then 3 design features to look out for.

<br>

![Tedd-Space Wellbeing Page represented on different devices](docs/snapshots/tedd-space-wellbeing-am-i-responsive.png)

### **Community Page**

<br>

* This provides the user with information about the community aspect of Tedd-Space.  The timetable of activities is prominent and features the same background leaf image used on the landing page.  The follow us button makes it easy for the user to find social media links, and there is a link to direct them back  to the timetable if they have scrolled past this but then want to find out more.  

* The slide show provides the user with an opportunity to interact with the site and build an understanding of how the garden could be used.

* Descriptions of 3 different types of community engagement are detailed in the familiar 3 column layout (collapses to single column on mobile devices below 950px).  Font awesome icons ensure that there is continuity and familiarity between pages.

<br>

![Tedd-Space Community Page represented on different devices](docs/snapshots/tedd-space-community-am-i-responsive.png)

### **Visit Page**

<br>

* Now that the user has been presented with information about the garden and it's benefits, it is important to provide them with the information needed to visit.  An interactive embedded Google Map shows location and if zoomed out, can give the user context about surrounding areas.  Also core information with full address and opening hours, makes the opportunity to use the garden as simple as possible.  The site owner hopes that this will result in an increase in the user base.

<br>

![Tedd-Space Visit Page represented on different devices](docs/snapshots/tedd-space-visit-am-i-responsive.png)

### **Volunteer Page**

<br>

* Users are presented with some information about the volunteering opportunities.  They will also have the opportunity to interact with a form by submitting their name, email address, using a drop down menu to signal their availability and a text field for any further details.  A send button with familiar consistent hover effect allows users to submit this information.  Feedback will be give to the user throughout the form interaction, with each input field highlighted when in focus and tooltip alerts if a required field has not been filled in correctly.

<br>

![Tedd-Space Volunteer Page represented on different devices](docs/snapshots/tedd-space-volunteer-am-i-responsive.png)

### **Thankyou Page**

* Once the form has been submitted successfully, feedback will given to the user by directing them to a thankyou page.  Here they will be thanked for their interest and told that someone from Tedd-Space will be in touch as soon as possible.  The keep exploring button allows users to be guided back to the website home page. 

<br>

![Tedd-Space Thankyou Page represented on different devices](docs/snapshots/tedd-space-thankyou-am-i-responsive.png)

<br>

### **Meta Tags for social media display**

<br>

Open Graph and Twitter meta tags have ben used in the head of each page to control how the URL is displayed when shared on social media.  They make content more eye catching in social media feeds, tell people what the content is at a glance and can also increase your brand visibiity through searches.  I learnt about them through this [article](https://ahrefs.com/blog/open-graph-meta-tags/).  Below is an image of how the site is displayed on social media feeds:

<br>

## **SURFACE**

___

<br>

## **Colour Palette**

<br>

The website aims to use a calming colour palette to align with the Tedd-Space ethos of promoting calm minds.  The user should get the same sense of calmness and wellbeing when navigating the site as they would when visiting the garden.  Green is known to be a soothing colour and also gives the user a sense of being surrounded by nature.  The palette is limited to keep the site looking clean, simple and spacious.  Colours from the [close up leaf](docs/leaf-hero-ref.webp) hero image were extracted using the generator tool on the [coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.  This is the basis for the dark green text that is used consistently throughout the site and the occassional lighter green that is used to give user feedback when hovering over buttons.  The white smoke colour is used against a pure white backdrop to structure the website in a simple clean way, highlighting columns,text boxes and the footer. 

<br>

![Tedd-Space colour palette](docs/tedd-space-colour-palette-resize.png)


<br>

## **Contrast**

<br>

The simple colour palette means that there is good contrast between the background and text.  I used the WebAim [contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to investigate contrasts.

<br>

![Tedd-Space colour palette contrast check](docs/tedd-space-contrast-check.png)

<br>

To ensure that the contrast between the hero background image and hero text was optimal, I applied a linear gradient on the image as a CSS rule to make it darker and help the white text stand out more.

<br>

## **Typography**

<br>

Spacing and typography will remain consistent throughout the site to give the user a sense of familiarity wherever they navigate to another page.  Icons will be used alongside informational headings to hint at content.  The following fonts have been selected from Google Fonts:

* Headings:  Montserrat.  This is a sans-serif font.
* Body:  Source Sans Pro.  This is a sans-serif font.
* Hero text and Summer Timetable:  Amatic SC.  This is a cursive font.

Inspiration for the font combination came from this [article](https://www.thedenizenco.com/journal/clean-minimal-font-pairings) about clean minimal font pairings. 

<br>

## **Imagery**

<br>

Imagery throughout aims to tie in with the goals of the site, for example images of the garden should provide a feeling of calm. Images focusing on the social commmunity aspect should be friendly and welcoming.  The logo used in the header has been chosen for it's simplicity yet it is still able to covey a message to the user - "this is a site that focuses on improving your wellbeing".

## **Accessibility**

___

<br>

To enusure that the website is as accessible as possible for all users and compatible with screen readers, I have done the following:

* Semantic markup has been used to structure the HTML code.
* Check that the colour contrast ratio across the website meets acceptable standards.
* Descriptive alt attributes have been given to all images.
* Aria labels have been used for interactive elements where no accessible name is provided. For example the hamburger menu icon I have used for smaller screen sizes or the social media links in the footer.
* The aria hidden attribute has been added to icons that are purely decorative.

 I want to view address details and opening hours. | Details required to visit Tedd-Space are accessed easily via the "visit" menu link. As this is a core goal for the client, the link exists at the highest level of the site information architecture structure.  One click and the user can gather the information they need to visit. |                             
| I want to learn more about the activities that run in partnership with the garden. | The "Community" text box on the home page encourages the user to explore the community page.  Once they arrive, they can intuitively get a sense of the activities on offer, either by interacting with the image slideshow, reading the informational text boxes or using the timetable.  Users are also directed to social media channels to get more detailed and live information. |
| I want to be able to find out more about volunteering. |  The benefits of volunteering are introduced to the user in the "Belong" text box on the homepage, encouraging them to explore further and navigate to the volunteer page.  This can also be accessed directly via the navigation menu if the user has come to the site with this goal as their sole focus. |                      
|       |                                                         
| Return Visitors |                                                             
|       |                                                                      
| I want to make contact to offer my time as a volunteer. | Return users can head straight to the volunteer page via the navigation menu and use the form to submit their details. |                    
| I want to learn **more** about how horticulture and being surrounded by nature can improve our mental health. | Return users can head straight to the Wellbeing page to do this.  Future implementations such as a blog or specially curated articles for the site will make this goal more achievable, as they will provide greater depth of information for return visitors. |
|       | 
| Repeat Visitors |                                                            
|       |                                                                      
| I want to be kept up to date with Tedd-Space news, updates and future events. | The community page does satisfy this goal in a limited way, but future implementations such as integrating live social media feeds to the site would offer greater value to repeat vistitors, as they could use the site for the most accurate and up to date information. |

## **Bugs**

<br>

### **Known Bugs**

<br>

1. When interacting with the image slideshow, clicking on any of the slider-nav anchor tags will display a new image but this also jumps the slideshow to the top of the page.  This is not too problematic as it brings the slideshow into focus, but this may be something to fix in future development.  From investigation on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28377760/when-the-image-of-my-slideshow-changes-the-browser-jumps-to-the-top-of-the-page), it seems that using the # in the anchor tag will always bring the user to the top of the page.

2. Input fields for the form when in focus are still displaying with a blue border when viewed in Firefox or Safari.

3. When the timetable link is clicked on iPad or iPhone, it remains underlined.  This does not happen in Google dev tools when I imitate the same screen sizes so seems to be related to how the device is reading this.

<br>

### **Solved Bugs**

<br>

1. When I set my header to be fixed so that it always remained visible as the user scrolled down the page, this caused the problem that I would lose the first section of my page content under the header.  I fixed this by adding a margin-top to the hero image so that it was pushed down and started in the correct position. I also created a top-row class to apply this margin-top to other pages.  Even when I applied the top-row class to the div containing the google map, the required top margin did not appear so I added this margin rule in to the google-map class which was successful.

![Fixed Header bug example](docs/bugs/tedd-space-bug-fixed-header.png)

2. Originally, when an input field on the volunteer form was selected and in focus, this would be highlighted with a default blue border.  This was jarring visually as it was out of keeping with the exisiting colour palette.  I fixed this by writing a css rule to make the outline colour of any input or text area when in focus, the same primary dark green colour that is used throughout the site. 

3. Even when switching to the hamburger menu, at the smaller end of mobile screen devices around 450px the logo, title and hamburger menu became too squashed and the header looked cluttered.  Initially to fix this I used a media query to move the hamburger menu underneath the title and logo. Here is the code I wrote:

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 450px) {
    #nav-container {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
    }
    #logo {
        margin-left: 0;
        align-items: center;
    }

    #logo img {
        margin-top: 6px;
        margin-bottom: 0;       
    }

    #logo h1 {
        margin-bottom: 0;
    }
    
    #hamnav .toggle {
        position:unset;
        margin: 0;
        line-height: normal;
    }
    #hamburger:checked ~ ul.top-menu {
        margin-top: 1rem;
    }
}
```
This did decrease the clutter, but I was never quite happy with the visual aesthetic and preferred to keep the burger menu fixed to the right as this is where users expect to find it.  Also this solution increased the height of the header which is not desireable for small mobile devices where screen space is limited.  After a conversation with my mentor, he confirmed that it would be acceptable to shrink down the size of the title, logo and menu in order to keep everything in a row.

4. In testing, there was no cursor pointer when hovering over the form send button, so I added this as a css rule.
