# **Tedd-Space Wellbeing Garden Website**
The Tedd-Space website has been designed to provide visitors with the opportunity to gather information about a fictional community wellbeing garden based in Teddington, TW11.  The goal of the site owner is to create an online presence to give greater exposure to the garden and increase the user base within the TW11 community. There is a particular emphasis on the positive impact of horticulture and nature on our wellbeing and mental health.

Site users can learn about the ethos and vision of the garden, gain better understanding of the links between nature and wellbeing, gather information about how the garden engages the local community, and easily find the details they need to visit.   They can also learn about volunteering opportunities and register their interest in getting involved.

## **STRATEGY**

### **Why build this site?**
<br>
The wellbeing garden was completed in April 2022. Market research carried out by Richmond Council within the local community has highlighted that many residents of TW11 do not know about the garden. So a core goal of the website will be to increase exposure in the hope of attracting a new diverse user base.

<br>

Research has highlighted the toll that the pandemic had on wellbeing and mental health.  So another core goal of the website will be to emphasise how the benefits of the garden can be two fold. Time spent outside engaging with nature along with the opportunity to reduce isolation by connecting with the community.

<br>

### **What is needed?**

<br>

The website will be an online resource where users will go to understand more about the garden, how they can visit and how it could improve their lives.
